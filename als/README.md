# Artificial Life Simulator

> Foked from [rodrigosetti/biotopia](https://github.com/rodrigosetti/biotopia)

# Changes

Added two types of creatures **predators**(red) and **herbivorous**(yellow). **Predators** can gain energy only by eating **herbivorous**. **Herbivorous** gain energy by earing **food**.
> This feature is not yet added due to poor performance.

# Biotopia

Biotopia is a simple Artificial Life Simulator inspired in a program of the
same name created by Anthony Liekens (version 2.0 released in 1995).

It works by letting creatures live in a simulated environment, where there's a
competition for food and reproduction. Because of that competition we can observe a
statistics tendency of complexity increase and adaptation.

  * `v`: toggle vertical wrapping.

## Main concepts

Creatures, in this simulator, are simple beings with a multi-cellular
structure. The very arrangement of its cells determines both its movement
throughout the world, as well as its capacity of eating and reproduce.

To live, each creature looses energy, therefore, they must eat to keep up
energy amount bigger than zero. If it ever reaches zero, the creature dies and
its transformed into food for other creatures to consume.

Reproduction is assexual by means of self-replication, and have a change of
random mutation (which means a single change in its structure). Creatures do
not interact directly with each other.

## The environment

There are two resources in the environment, represented as particles (pixels
dots) scattered all over the place. These are:

  * food - dark green pixels. They provide energy to the creature.
  * key particles - cyan pixels. They are the only source of reproduction.

Each creature is born with a limited amount of energy, and at each simulation
cycle, this energy is decreased by a fixed amount (default is 1). When the
creature's energy reaches zero, it dies.

In order to rise its energy level, the creature must walk over the space and
"eat" the food particles (dark green). Upon eating, the food particle
disappears from the environment, and it's added a certain amount of energy
(default 10) to the creature.

When death occurs (energy reaches zero) the creature stops operating and its
structure is transformed in food particles and one key particle, which can be
consumed by other creatures.

The key particle (cyan pixels), when eat, replicates the creature -
creating an identical offspring, with change of random mutation - in place. The
new offspring will have a standard energy to start its life, and will have a
random rotation of -90 or +90 degrees. This is the only way a creature might
reproduce (by eating key particles).

Both food particles and key particles are created in the environment only when
a creature dies (except, of course, at the start of simulation).

The simulation can have two behaviours regarding the limits of the world:

  * wrapping - in this case, a creature, when reaching the border, will
    reappear in the other end an continue moving. When both vertical and
    horizontal wrapping are enabled, the world will have a torus topology.
  * collision - in this case, a creature, when reaching the border, will mirror
    horizontally (if reaching the width limit) or vertically (if reaching the
    heigth limit), therefore, changing its movement direction like a
    reflection.

## Creatures
### Structure

Creature behaviour is governed by its structure. A creature structure can be
represented by a set of connected dots (called cells, red or yellow pixels). One of
this cells is a special one, and its called "head cell", colored purple.

The head cell functions exactly as the other cells, so, it does not matter
which cell is the head. The only difference is that, upon death, all regular
cells are transformed into food particles, whist the head cell is transformed
into a key particle.

The creature structure must obey certain rules, they are:

  * All cells must be connected to the head.
  * There must not exists cycles (i.e. starting from the head, and following
    neighbours, one cannot reach the same cell again).

By neighbours we mean only orthogonal, not diagonals.

With these rules in mind, lets see some concrete valid and invalid examples (in
these examples, empty space is represented as `.`, and cells are represented as
`o`).

These are all valid examples:

    ..... ..... .....
    .o.o. .oo.. .o...
    .ooo. .o.o. .ooo.
    ..... .ooo. .o...
    ..... ..... .....

On the other hand, the following examples are invalid, because they contain
cycles:

    ..... ..... .....
    .o.o. .ooo. .ooo.
    .ooo. .o.o. .o.o.
    .oo.. .ooo. .ooo.
    ..... ..... .....

At each reproduction (i.e. key particle eating) the offspring will be an exact
copy of its parent, with a change of random mutation. A mutation is either
adding or removing a single cell in a way that does not yield an invalid
structure - therefore, an invalid structure can never occur.

### Movement

Creatures moves in the environment depending on its structure. The movement
depends solely on what is called "flagellum". These are cells that have only
one neighbour. The flagellum, though, can have one of four possible
configurations depending where the neighbour is: upward, downward, left, or
right.

For example, the following structure has three flagellum, one faced upwards,
one faced left, and the other faced right:

    .....
    ..o..
    .ooo.
    .....

These flagella can be interpreted as direction pointers.

Each flagellum adds to a direction coefficient. In this example, the two
horizontal flagellum (left and right) rule out each other, thereby resulting in
a horizontal coefficient of zero. The upward flagellum adds a unbalanced
vertical coefficient (in this case, -1).

So, by summing up the flagella directions, we came out with horizontal and
vertical coefficients. To sum up, we must consider that upward flagella adds
-1 to the vertical coefficient, downwards flagella adds 1 to the vertical
coefficient; left flagella adds -1 to the horizontal coefficient, and right
flagella adds 1 to horizontal coefficient.

The following examples have (0,-2), (1,-1), and (1, 0) of (horizontal,
vertical) coefficients respectively:

    ..... ..... .....
    .o.o. .oo.. .o...
    .ooo. .o.o. .ooo.
    ..... .ooo. .o...
    ..... ..... .....

At each cycle, a creature may walk only one pixel in each direction. The actual
move is draw from a creature's internal cyclic movement (i.e. it repeats), that
have the following rule:

  * A creature always stands still one cycle (i.e. walk (0,0))
  * Then, at each i-th cycle, the creature will have a movement equals to
    `(sign(H) if i < |H| else 0, sign(V) if i < |V| else 0)`, for i from 1 to
    `max(|H|, |V|)`; Where `H` is the horizontal coefficient; `V` is the
    vertical coefficient; `sign(x)` is -1 if `x < 0`, 0 if `x = 0`, or 1
    otherwise; and `|x|` is the absolute value of `x`.

For example, for a (horizontal, vertical) coefficient of (-1,2), a creature will
have the following movement cycle:

  * (0, 0)
  * (-1, 1)
  * (0, 1)

For coefficients equals to (1,1), we'll have the following cycle:

  * (0, 0)
  * (1, 1)

Likewise, for coefficients equals to (1,-1), we'll have the following cycle:

  * (0, 0)
  * (1,-1)

For coefficients equals to (0,10), we'll have the following cycle:

  * (0, 0)
  * (0, 1)
  * (0, 1)
  * (0, 1)
  * (0, 1)
  * (0, 1)
  * (0, 1)
  * (0, 1)
  * (0, 1)
  * (0, 1)
  * (0, 1)

Note that, the bigger the coefficient, the faster will be the movement of the
creature in that dimension, because it'll less often stand still. Also, for a
creature to have perfect diagonal movement, it must have equal absolute
values of the horizontal and vertical coefficients. Finally, creatures that
have the coefficients equals to (0,0) will never move (that's a bad thing,
because it won't eat and reproduce - leading quickly to death).

### Eating

The structure of the creature also determines where are its "mouths". A
creature might have zero or more mouths. Mouth is a place in an neighbour empty
space where the creature can consume both food and key particles.

For a mouth to exist, the empty space should have at least three cell
neighbours (orthogonal neighbours might have at most four cell neighbours;
therefore it must have 3 or 4 neighbours). It doesn't matter if the cell is a
regular (yellow or red) or head (cyan) type.

For example, in the following structures, we denote with an `*` the place where
a mouth exists:

    ..... ..... ..... .......
    .o*o. .oo.. .o... .o*o*o.
    .ooo. .o*o. .ooo. .ooooo.
    ..... .ooo. .o... ..o*o..
    ..... ..... ..... .......

A creature with zero mouths (third example in the previous row) will obviously
die pretty soon because it cannot feed itself, and, because it cannot eat key
particles, will never reproduce. On the other hand, creatures with more mouths
than the average will have selective advantage because they'll more easily be
able to feed and reproduce.

## Evolution

The starting ancestral are creatures with the following structure:

    .....
    .o.o.
    .ooo.
    .....

They have one mouth and moving coefficients (0,-2), therefore, they move
vertically down two of three of its movement cycle:

  * (0, 0)
  * (0, -1)
  * (0, -1)

All the rotations of the ancestral also exists, so the movements are variate,
but all of them orthogonal and the same speed.

Just to make clear the rotation and mirroring concepts. The following creatures
are all equivalent (i.e. the same) (rotations and mirrors of the same
structure):

    ...... ...... ..... ..... ..... ..... ...... ......
    .o.oo. .oo.o. .oo.. ..oo. ..o.. ...o. ..ooo. .ooo..
    .ooo.. ..ooo. .o... ...o. ..oo. ..oo. .oo.o. .o.oo.
    ...... ...... .oo.. ..oo. ...o. ..o.. ...... ......
    ...... ...... ..o.. ..o.. ..oo. ..oo. ...... ......
    ...... ...... ..... ..... ..... ..... ...... ......

The environment is started with some of them, and some amount of free food and
key particles scattered around the world.

Pretty soon, we observe that the descendants will show a tendency to increase
complexity of its structure by incorporating more mouths and better movements
strategies (i.e. faster and diagonals).
